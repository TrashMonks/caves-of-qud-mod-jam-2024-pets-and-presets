His hands grew stiff around the handle. What would become of his garden without its water? When he could no longer tend it?

No. He loved these plants. He would see them cared for even in his Jeweled Dusk.

In the quiet of the Bettle Moon Zenith, in a small workshop, in a gentle corner of the world, he worked.

With wire and servo and solder and will, he breathed life into the pair.

The cans once but metal and paint, given life to give it again.

{{watery|Drip}} and {{watery|Drop}} he named them, and to them he gave his garden.

He rested, and his garden flourished once more. These plants loved him.

When moons had passed the quiet of the garden was shatterd by howling wind that brought the salt of Moghra'yi, the garden died.

And when {{watery|Drop}} could not be found, {{watery|Drip}} with the last the vines that now clutched their old friend, set off to bring them home.
