Most cats struggle with being held by the neck... observe!

{{emote|*With a swift jerk of their head, {{c-C-c-C sequence|Dawn}} covers over {{m-M-m-M sequence|Dusk}}'s neck.*}}

We are not most cats...

You see, {{m-M-m-M sequence|Dusk}} and I are quite immune to the weaknesses of our kin.

{{emote|*{{m-M-m-M sequence|Dusk}} rolls their eyes.*}}

When we work together, of course.~
Seldom, I'll imagine the 'myself', apart from {{m-M-m-M sequence|Dusk}}.

It is not a better time, without my other half. These dangers, this... journey.

Perhaps you know, =name=... it is not one best faced alone.

{{emote|*{{c-C-c-C sequence|Dawn}} motions to preen {{m-M-m-M sequence|Dusk}}'s head. Shortly afterwards, their chin is met with a reciprocal, grateful, bathing.*}}

Even when we bicker, I know that we can rely on each other. I wouldn't want to go back to a time before that certainty.~
Given my relative position, {{m-M-m-M sequence|Dusk}} often decides where we end up. We've learned to come to terms with it... or, at least, I have.

If you'd like us somewhere specific, allow me to pass it along to {{m-M-m-M sequence|Dusk}} on your behalf.

{{emote|**{{c-C-c-C sequence|Dawn}} appears to relish the thought.*}}~
In case you'd like me to settle a bet, I do not 'get along with dawngliders'.

Maybe once, I could've, but something overtakes me... and...

{{emote|*{{c-C-c-C sequence|Dawn}}, lost in thought, chitters out a killing bite.*}}

Ah, pardon me. But surely that should give you a hint.

		Quite so!

        {{emote|*The overall height of the two cats shifts as {{c-C-c-C sequence|Dawn}} adopts a far prouder posture.*}}

		{{emote|It is not typical to see the colour drain from a cat's face, but it appears to happen to {{c-C-c-C sequence|Dawn}}.*}}
		Sultans preserve us... we are?!

		Ah... I mean... of course we are! Well, fear not... {{m-M-m-M sequence|Dusk}} and I are legends of this place.

		{{emote|*{{c-C-c-C sequence|Dawn}} reacts with surprise, but attempts to hide their blushing with bluster.*}}

		Yes, well... cute or not, it was won through dedication... cunning... and honour.

		In fact, {{m-M-m-M sequence|Dusk}} and I decided that, as we'd so outgrown out peers, we should title ourselves.

		After all, we're like... the Spindle. We stand alone, and overlook all of Qud... it's a lonely existence...
