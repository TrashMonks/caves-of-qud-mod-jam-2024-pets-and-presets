    <part Name="Description" Short="The paradigm for arranging felines has shifted. Why settle for merely one cat {{K|(in merely one location!)}} when multiple may occupy the same space?

This very peculiar arrangement of pet hopes to answer those needs {{K|(or, at least, it can be used as reason to not continue to ask the question)}}.

Above, the radiant glistening of {{c-C-c-C sequence|Dawn}} is pleasant, and ever-twinkling. The long-suffering {{m-M-m-M sequence|Dusk}}, below, seems quite peeved by the burden placed on its shoulders." />
