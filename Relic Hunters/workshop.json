  "Description": "——————————————————————————————————————————————————\r\n\r\n🚨 UPDATE: 🚨\r\n\r\nJake its a functional mech now\r\n\r\nJake has a \"Stash\" inside which is an entity that sells you stuff**\r\n It restocks with 👀 interesting possibilities (if you have hundreds of hours in CoQ and struggle to find a ganglionic teleprojector, now you have a more reliable source)\r\n\r\n**4 New Weapons:  with custom tiles, tested and balanced, and some interesting combinations from existing mechanics, to create new dynamics and (i hope) to result in new interesting weapons.\r\n\r\nA lot— of balance to a lot of things:\r\nAs already said: All the weapons.\r\nJake is not a cheese xp machine anymore. He is older and grown up, he refrains from violence. (Despite that, I tried to keep him interesting).\r\nHe now functions just as a \"safe house\" and can use his tools to stay safe, but you might also need to take care of him anyway (I do recommend commanding him to stay in hubs or safe spaces).\r\nRebalance to his stats, skills and mutations, to an appropriate level; AI (behavior), body parts and items.\r\n\r\n——————————————————————————————————————————————————\r\n\n\n\n✨( Itch webpage is the same but way better: https://dancerogue.itch.io/relic-hunters :) ✨\r\n\r\n\r\n[in announcer voice]\r\n— Are YOU tired of dealing with low-tier relics that always give you the WRONG equipment with the WRONG stats ?\r\n\r\n*Insert an image of a disappointed Multi-Legged Chimera with +1 INT Leather Boots*\r\n\r\n— Have YOU lost faith or interest in exploring Historic Sites due to the constant disappointment of finding SINGLE-USE Relics ?!?!\r\n\r\n*Insert an image of a sad young Hindren holding a Cube with a useless oblivious beetle behind him*\r\n\r\n— Are you SICK of putting in SO MUCH EFFORT, wiping out ENTIRE CULTS of long-faced, BORING Equines, only to be CONSTANTLY DISAPPOINTED ?!?!?!?!??!?!\r\n\r\nREGAIN THE FAITH AND THRILL OF WONDERING:\r\n\"WHAT WILL MY NEXT NEW 'TOY' BE?\"\r\nJUST LIKE YOUR FIRST TIME EXPLORING QUD\r\nWITH THE BRAND NEW MOD:\r\n\r\n🎉 ¡¡¡¡¡¡ RELIC HUNTERS !!!!!! 🎉\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdds: ➕ \r\n\r\n✅ —  A Relic Hunter adventurer preset\r\n\r\n✅ —  Another Relic Hunter as a Plant-Person (inspired by Fern: a grass-made counterpart of Fin the Human)\r\n\r\n✅ —  A pet, Jake the Dog, featuring a suit-armor mode—just like in the series!\r\n(He acts as a mini-mecha !!!)\r\n\r\n✅ —  And four new custom weapons with interesting details to make them unique, intricate, and keep them balanced, currently in the possession of Jake the Dog! (He also has some of your relic-hunting gadgets—he might think they’re his now... oops :/ )\r\n\r\n✅ —  A merchant!! I create an entity inside Jake that acts as his stash. Besides having a low probability of finding this weapons on high tier areas, you can buy them from his stash.\r\nALSO: If Jake dies, his stash is dropped on the ground, undamage. So you don't lose access to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n​​​​​​​​❌— A single-use, consumable Relic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\n\r\n​► This mod was created to introduce a couple of utility-based builds along with a pet that you can enter for added protection that the presets lack.\r\n\r\n► The 'Adventure Time' theme ended up being the perfect fit for these mechanics: the post-post-apocalyptic setting, cute-weird mutated characters, and weaponize-nature end up fitting the ~Caves of Qud's vibes~.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHighlights: 🚨\r\n\r\n• The Relic Hunter preset is designed to try your luck with the random Relics in your run\r\n\r\n• Go in and out of Historic Sites, \"stealing” the relics without combat. BUT! It can still be challenging, so you have to know what you're doing. With the guaranteed reprogrammable recoiler, you can dig down directly into the last floor of a Historic Site and recoil back using Force Wall, present in both pressets.\r\n\r\n• Jake the Dog appears in his eerie, blue alien form\r\nJust like \"Fin\" is actually his green plant-person counterpart\r\nJake is designed to protect the player: you can interact with him and 'enter' him, like a wearable armor suit (Just Like in the show :P). And much more.\r\n\r\n\r\n​There are some references that people who really like Adventure Time might recognize :)\r\n(but I wouldn't say it’s strictly Adventure Time themed :P )\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLinks: 🔗\r\n\r\n\r\nGitHub: https://github.com/Beautiful-Bug/Relic-Hunter-mod-for-Caves-of-Qud.git\r\n\r\nItch webpage again https://dancerogue.itch.io/relic-hunters :)\r\n\r\nThis is was an entry for the Caves of Qud Modding Jam: Pets & Presets. 2024\r\n\n",
