  "Title": "Unquiet Needle",
  "Description": "Here's my entry for the 2024 Pets and Presets modding jam. It's mostly a proof-of-concept for how a sapient, talking weapon could work with the mechanics of Qud. I threw it all together rather quickly, hopefully all the conversations and the questline work as it should. I have no clue whether any of it is balanced, but I hope that it is at the veay least fun to toy around with.\n\nIs yours the hand that will guide the Unquiet Needle to its destiny?\n\nThanks to:\nBarnabusBarnabas, for helping with the concepts for various pieces of lore and mechanics\nlibrarianmage, for helping with the modding process\nYulia and wizardlizard for giving feedback on the sprites\r",
