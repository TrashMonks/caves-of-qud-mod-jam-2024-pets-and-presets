A spider easily mistaken for a mote of dust hops across a forest floor in search of prey. At that very moment, pure happenstance dictates a ruin long reclaimed by the jungle decayed enough to collapse. Ampoules of some forgotten purpose tumble out of the wreckage, shattering in the path of the diminutive arachnid, single drop of their contents engulfing her form.

Minutes pass as she is trapped in the droplet, and those minutes bring changes: growth, and perhaps More. Soon freed by sheer virtue of her new size, she continues on her way as minutes become hours, days, months. Her mind grows, too, no longer filled with merely the instinct to hunt and survive. She now holds a curiosity about the shadows that pass in the canopy overhead and the blue-twinkling-black expanse even further beyond. So it is that she leaves her once-home for the first time to sate these curiosities and more.

The azure spider, standing shoulder height to the largest wild hounds, emerges from the jungles of Qud, peering at the noon sky.
