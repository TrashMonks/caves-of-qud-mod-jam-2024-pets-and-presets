A lone wanderer trudges through the jungles of Qud, following Seir as he glides from ruin to ruin, searching for anything that may cause his master harm. Seir was once one of many Rust Gliders; small gliding mammals popular among anyone traveling through the jungles of Qud. But as the years swept by, and generations came and went, they were used less and less, and they slowly died out. Seir is now among the last of his kind, but he still serves his masters just as eagerly as any other of his kind would; for even if he is to be the last Rust Glider to walk the lands of Qud, he will fulfill his duties just as those before him has.
