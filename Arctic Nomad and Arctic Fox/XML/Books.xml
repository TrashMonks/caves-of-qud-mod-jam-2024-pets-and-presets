    <page>
In the midst of the frigid north wherein no mere creature of flesh and blood may survive the denizens of such places are strange and uncanny beings of flesh cloaked in the power of the ice and snow. Among the hoary terrors of those frigid lands there are few prey creatures to be found and they have been twisted in strange manner also making them no easy meal yet where brutality fails cunning may succeed. In the midst of such arctic nightmares arctic foxes lurk and hunt, little changed from their mythic ancestors of elder days whose cunning outwitted even the sultans of old. Rarely one may deign to take up an alliance with the men of the north for mutual aid in places where even wolves fear to tread.
