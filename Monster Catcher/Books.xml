      <page>
  Long ago, in the ageless time before even the ice melted, Hampesper had a family. She would frolic with others of her kin, though now she barely remembers their smells. What still lingers in her tiny nostrils is the rancid stench of the girsh, and so she lingers in kind.
  Often seen as merely a curiosity, more rarely recognised for her power, many have sought the last hampster. On one occasion, an altar was fashioned out of volcanic glass from the Fuming God Sea and bluest carbide from the depths of Qud. A perfect sphere, like those she'd known long ago.
  Now, lurking in her ball, she lies in wait one who would wield her - so she can turn them towards her own ambitions.
