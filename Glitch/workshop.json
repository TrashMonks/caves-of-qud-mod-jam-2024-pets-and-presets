  "Title": "Glitch Preset & Error Pet",
  "Description": "[h3]Made for the [url=https://itch.io/jam/caves-of-qud-modding-jam-3]Pets & Presets Modding Jam[/url]![/h3]\n\n[i][b]Spoiler Warning:[/b] Using this mod may expose you to late-game abilities, liquids, and sprites.[/i]\n\nThis is a mod that adds a new preset, 'Glitch', and a new pet, 'ERROR'.\n\n[b][u]The Glitch Preset:[/u][/b]\u000b[list]\u000b[*] Has every mutation that has another mutation it's incompatible with (save for every defect with each other). For example, it has both freeze and flame rays, as well as both a carapace and quills!\u000b[*] Needs to have extra work put in to actually use its mutation points, as it's both an Esper and a Chimera (preventing mutation buying), and all it's mutations are already trying to auto-advance to levels far beyond normal limits!\u000b[*] Lacks intelligence despite being a Scholar. On the other hand, it has an excessive amount of Ego!\u000b[*] Custom sprite!\n[*] Bug-Free playthrough not guaranteed: The game may or may not eventually get sick of you using this forbidden preset and deny you levels! \u000b[/list]\u000b\u000b[b][u]'ERROR', the pet:[/u][/b]\n[list]\n[*] A Zero Jell that's constantly shifting its appearance!\u000b[*] Capable of manipulating space... but sometimes has trouble containing its power.\n[*] Just having ERROR as your pet is less likely to cause buggy behavior than using the Glitch preset... but ERROR causes far more chaos than most bugs could hope to achieve.\u000b[/list]\u000b\u000bThe Pets & Presets Modding Jam encouraged making a mod without using C# scripting, so this mod was my attempt to make something as chaotic and glitch-themed as I could using tools that are already available in the game's code. I hope you enjoy it! :)",
