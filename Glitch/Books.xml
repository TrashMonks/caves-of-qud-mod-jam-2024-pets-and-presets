Once upon a time, a particularly entropic zero jell found itself at the exact point in space-time where several shifting leylines were crossing.

It began to pull at the chaotic forces around it, and found that while it could begin to move, it couldn't fully free itself from the entanglement of the surrounding entropy.

Ultimately accepting this, and putting forth great effort, it made its way to our reality, ready to do its best at assisting the one person in existence it cares about...
