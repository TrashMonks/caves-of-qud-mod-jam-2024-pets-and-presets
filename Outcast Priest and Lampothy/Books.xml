'Do you think it's possible to make a reflection real?'

'What?'

'Think about it. What if you could reach in through a mirror and pull out your reflection. What do you think that would be like? Would it still be you? Just... flipped?'

'Hm. Well, I don't think it would be all that substantial. It's just reflected light, after all - there wouldn't be anything physical behind it. I don't think you would be able to pull it out at all, if it were possible in the first place. Besides, the glass would be in the way.'

'Right! Yes, the glass. That certainly is one problem to overcome. But what if it wasn't a problem? If there wasn't any glass? Imagine placing a, a food cube, for example, in front of a glass-less mirror and presto! You're able to procure for yourself an exact near-perfect duplicate.'

'I still think it wouldn't be practical. It seems as though you're just talking about a hologram, one created using an excessive amount of expense. But... I suppose if such a thing were possible, it certainly would be interesting. Especially if the food cube were placed in front of multiple mirrors.'

'That's... That's genius! A method to clone anything, limited only by the number and size of reflective surfaces! I wonder if the energy required to do so would be additive or exponential...'

'I'm not sure. I imagine the energy intake would be similar, perhaps multipled, by the amount of times the light has to reflect - if indeed it's modified at all. But it is an interesting hypothetical, all the same. This is all hypothetical, right?'

'...Of course.'
