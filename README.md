# Pets & Presets Mash-Up Mod Pack
Mod jam pack for the November 2024 [Caves of Qud Mod Jam: Pets & Presets](https://itch.io/jam/caves-of-qud-modding-jam-3). See all the entries [here](https://itch.io/jam/caves-of-qud-modding-jam-3/entries)!

A gigantic feathered phase-harmonic thanks to all who participated! â€” The mod jam organizers

Add a pet while playing using the in-game wish menu (Debug > Wish Menu, bound to <kbd>shift</kbd>-<kbd>W</kbd> by default) or by wishing `jamaddpet`. Choose the "Spawn Every Pet" pet during character creation to start the game with every pet (*chaos will ensue*; also accessible via the wish menu).

This version of the pack is for the 1.0.4 release (build 210.X) of Caves of Qud.

**Warning**: Do not run this pack simultaneous with any of the mods contained within.
