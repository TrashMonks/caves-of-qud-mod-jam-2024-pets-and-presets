Mod jam pack for the November 2024 [Caves of Qud Mod Jam: Pets & Presets](https://itch.io/jam/caves-of-qud-modding-jam-3). See all the entries [here](https://itch.io/jam/caves-of-qud-modding-jam-3/entries)!

A gigantic feathered phase-harmonic thanks to all who participated! â€” The mod jam organizers

Wish for `jamaddpet` to open a menu to add a pet in-game, or choose the "Spawn Every Pet" pet to start the game with every pet (*chaos will ensue*).

This version of the pack is for the 208.X version of Caves of Qud.

**Warning**: Do not run this pack simultaneous with any of the mods contained within.
