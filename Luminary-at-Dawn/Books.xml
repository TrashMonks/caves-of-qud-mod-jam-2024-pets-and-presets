{{w|*She sings of a far-away tundra and a pure-white storm with no name and no mercy. Fading reds and pinks of abandoned towns could not withstand the might of the tempest, and so they crumble, dust away with each onrush of wind and snow. Only the star-beacon stands among the rubble, left behind by its masters to aimlessly provide guidance to the gray mass of corpses and ghosts. It remains steadfast, however, for it knows that nobody will be abandoned forever.

And it's right: behind the curtain of snow, two dying strangers trudge towards the light. A union shall be born, glorious and unbreakable.*}}
