As with every turn of the moon, the Children of the Fuming God gathered round the secret vents from which our god breaths. They swayed and cried in the heat and vapor and cast in the offerings. One by one they collapsed.

In the dreams brought on by the Godâ€™s Breath, they heard the wise Aji. The wise Aji led the loosened Children in prayer and vision.

They laughed.

They breathed.

One of the wise Aji was taken by the visions the Children shared. And so the wise Aji built for this one a pliable skin to carry the air of the Fuming God. And the Children dipped their shell hook into the vent and brought the brave, wise Aji into the shallow world.

- Recorder Vrikra, Fuming God-Child.
