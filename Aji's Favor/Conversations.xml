      <text>There are many unfamiliar liquids. They are cold and slippery.</text>
      <text>Salt crystals are everywhere. Some things don’t change.</text>
      <text>It is so bright, much of the time.</text>
      <text>So many chrome-children. The Fuming God speaks obliquely of them.</text>
      <text>I miss the rites with the God-Children. And the offerings.</text>
      <text>There are so many children, stacked atop one another, biting, screaming.</text>
      <text>It is grander and messier than the Dromads described.</text>
      <text>It is strange, stranger than even the God-Children described.</text>
      <text>The Spindle… it haunts my dreams.</text>
      <text>The earth is as porous as home. But colder, and full of more dead things.</text>
      <text>The taste of life, of death. It is everywhere. It is overwhelming.</text>

      <text>Rock or water, there are waves. Let the waves carry you.</text>
      <text>You will change. It will burn. You will endure.</text>
      <text>There are such wonders on this wave. Care for it well.</text>
      <text>In time, all will be ash. Live now.</text>
      <text>First, you must breath.</text>
      <text>When all else fails, breath.</text>
      <text>As thanks, give care.</text>
      <text>We are all children. Some are old children.</text>
      <text>Respect the Aji.</text>
      <text>Drink deep of the Fuming God's breath. Loosen the self, and see the waves.</text>
      <text>Inhale volcanic gases responsibly.</text>
