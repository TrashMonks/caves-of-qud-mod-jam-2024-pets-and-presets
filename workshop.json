  "Description": "[quote=Courage and Sense]It's the custom among patricians that first-born children, slated to inherit nothing of their families' estates, venture out of numb Ibul into the wide world, and that -- in the case of the Iuto family -- they shove off with the companionship of their household's foremost hound. So it came to be that Octadius, grown by manhood into a spiteful wreck, pledged his intention to cross bleak Arthax with his canine Hylaeus, who himself harbored no desire to abandon his lamplighted streets, but -- lacking the rights afforded to dogs in other parts of the world -- was forced to obey. And when Octadius, who cherished courage more than sense, found himself impaled on the fossilized stinger of a manscorpion, Hylaeus could do little more than look on with irritation at his own new predicament, and ponder how he might finish crossing the desert with his life in tow. By a hound's luck, though, several days of vexed wandering were rewarded with the company of a dromad caravan, which saw him safely to the white dunes of the East, and from there, to a curious land called Qud.[/quote]\n\nCompilation mod pack for the [url=https://itch.io/jam/caves-of-qud-modding-jam-3]Caves of Qud Modding Jam: Pets & Presets[/url], which ran at the start of November 2024.
